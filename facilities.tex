\textbf{\Large Facilities, Equipment, and Other Resources}
\end{center}

BECS Technology, Inc., is currently in the process of renovating
and moving into a new 42,000 sq. ft. facility located in
St. Louis county.
The move will be complete prior to the start of the project.

\subsection*{Laboratory}

The wet wall laboratory at BECS's current facility is shown below.

A recirculating water system is tapped at a number of horizontal
positions along the wall, and separate controllers (in the photo,
most have their covers open) are setup for any number of aquatic tests.
We have data logs from equipment installed on the wall going back
several years.

The new building has an even more extensive wet wall.

\subsection*{Office Space}

The engineering staff at BECS have individual workspaces that
expand the typical desk environment with additional logistics
that foster embedded systems design.
Specifically, for the software engineers, the software development
environment not only includes specialized software that executes
on the engineerâ€™s workstation, but it also includes copies of
the embedded systems under development, frequently augmented with
physical probe simulators, test harnesses, and the like.

\subsection*{Computer Equipment}

Beyond the normal desktop workstations that are ubiquitous in
the modern era, the additional computational resources required
for this project will be cloud-based, taking advantage of the current
infrastructure that serves the EZAnalytics\texttrademark{} product.

\subsection*{Laboratory Equipment and Software}

The BECS laboratory has bench power supplies, oscilloscopes, logic
analyzers, multimeters, and function generators.  Available CAD
software includes both schematic capture and board layout.

\subsection*{University Facilities}

The Dept.~of Computer Science and Engineering at
Washington Univ.~provides conventional office space
for both faculty and graduate students.
Dr.~Ottley's office is on the 4th floor of Jolley Hall.
Additional facilities needs will be met by BECS Technology.
